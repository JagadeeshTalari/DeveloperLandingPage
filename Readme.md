**I Enjoyed doing this project. And replicated the design of the page exactly** 

<br><br>


>**Learnings from the project**

- Importance of units rem, em, vh, percentages.
- During this project I learned - when designing a responsive design, we should design it independent of veiwport height i.e,
`we should not give the hieght in vh`

- media-queries & responsiveness
- image scale property (how to create a mirror image)
